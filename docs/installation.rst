Installation
==============

To ensure SPARTA is user-friendly and fully customizable, we recommend downloading all scripts directly from the GitHub repository.

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ git clone git@github.com:ideasrule/sparta.git
   $ cd sparta

For the tutorial for the photometry module, we will use data from the `Rocky Worlds DDT program <https://rockyworlds.stsci.edu/index.html>`_. 

Reference files
===============
For JWST data reduction, SPARTA requires the latest reference files from STScI. You can download them using the `CRDS <https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/>`_ system. Make sure that the version you choose matches your instruments and subarrays.
