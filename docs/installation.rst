Installation
==============

To ensure SPARTA is user-friendly and fully customizable, we recommend downloading all scripts directly from the GitHub repository.

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ git clone git@github.com:ideasrule/sparta.git
   $ cd SPARTA

For the tutorial, we will use data from the `Rocky Worlds DDT program <https://rockyworlds.stsci.edu/index.html>`_. The uncalibrated FITS files are provided in ``/SPARTA/tutorial/uncal/``.
